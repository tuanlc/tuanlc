I'm Tuan. I'm a Javascript full stack software developer & a team leader [@Linagora](https://linagora.com/). I'm very interesting in the software architecture field and I expect to connect & learn more on this field (Message Broker, Distributed System, etc).

Check out my blog @ [medium](https://congtuanle.medium.com/)
